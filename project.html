      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview: U.S. Sports Sponsorship Industry</h2>
        <p>
          For this project I used AI tools to analyze the <strong>U.S. sports sponsorship industry</strong>. 
          The report tracks how sports sponsorship revenue in the United States has grown from about 
          $12.1&nbsp;billion in 2014 to nearly $20&nbsp;billion in 2024, how COVID-19 caused an estimated 
          $14&nbsp;billion loss in 2020, and how the market quickly rebounded. Globally, sponsorship is 
          expected to reach around $115&nbsp;billion by 2025 and $160&nbsp;billion by 2030, with the U.S. 
          still holding roughly one-third of total share.
        </p>
        <p>
          A major theme is that <strong>sports sponsorship is overtaking ticket sales as the second-largest
          revenue stream in sports</strong>. Growth is driven by assets such as jersey patches, on-field and 
          digital signage, and new sponsor categories like tech, betting, and finance. The project highlights 
          key players (Nike, Adidas, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, major financial institutions) and properties like 
          the NFL, which generated roughly $2.35&nbsp;billion in sponsorship revenue in 2022–23. I also look 
          at the rapid rise of college Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL), where deals now make up a 
          $1.67&nbsp;billion market and turn college athletes into important sponsorship partners.
        </p>

      <!-- INDUSTRY STAGE -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2 class="section-title">Industry Stage: Growth with Emerging Risks</h2>
        <p>
          Using the evidence from my research, I classify the U.S. sports sponsorship industry as being in 
          a strong <strong>growth stage</strong>. Team sponsorship revenue has climbed to around $8&nbsp;billion 
          in 2024, and average per-team sponsorship revenue in major leagues is about $51&nbsp;million. New 
          events such as the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, plus momentum in women’s 
          sports, create additional upside.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, I discuss risks that could slow the pace of growth. These include potential 
          saturation in top leagues, economic headwinds, and uncertainty around NIL regulations. The project 
          argues that rights-holders and brands will need better data and more strategic targeting to sustain 
          long-run growth in sports sponsorship rather than just adding more logos in more places.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- DATA & AI TOOLS -->
      <section class="card">
        <h2 class="section-title">Data Landscape &amp; Role of AI</h2>
        <p>
          A key part of the project is mapping the <strong>data landscape for sports sponsorship</strong> and 
          showing how AI could help make sense of it. I summarize major data sources, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nielsen Sports for exposure tracking and sponsorship valuation across thousands of properties.</li>
          <li>SponsorUnited for detailed deal-level data by brand, property, asset type, and market.</li>
          <li>Opendorse and On3 for NIL deals, compensation estimates, and athlete–brand relationships.</li>
          <li>Kaggle and Forbes data sets on athlete earnings and endorsement income over time.</li>
          <li>Crunchbase for investment and growth data on sponsors, collectives, and sports marketing firms.</li>
          <li>Macro data from FRED, BLS, and BEA to connect sponsorship spending to the broader economy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I then outline ways that AI and analytics could deepen this research: time-series models of sponsorship 
          growth, category treemaps comparing sponsor spend by industry, and network graphs mapping connections 
          between brands, teams, athletes, and markets. In the project, AI mainly supports the <em>research 
          workflow</em>—helping organize sources, draft summaries, and propose visualizations—while I provide 
          the final interpretation and judgment about what the trends mean for the future of the U.S. sports 
          sponsorship market.
